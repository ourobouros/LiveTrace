Draw any picture in a combined virtual and augmented reality environment!

Although it IS fun to roam around a virtual world on the Oculus, we believe that virtual reality is at it's coolest when you can interact with real-life objects as well. LiveTrace AVR is an example of that vision and is meant to bring out the artist in you. We use the Oculus Rift to transfer you to a beautiful virtual environment that includes a sketchpad on which you can express your art. BUT, the sketchpad also exists in real life. 

Here is how it works: You see something inspiring, you take a picture of it and upload it using the LiveTrace AVR iOS app. You apply image processing on the image you took using the Mathematica script included. Then, you can pick a virtual environment to teleport to, grab the sketchpad and put the Oculus Rift on. The picture you took and processed appears as an overlay on your virtual sketchpad, which you can trace using a real marker on your real sketchpad, all while enjoying the view of a beautiful virtual environment.
